Decide by matching|2

Equate supply and demand with matching. Qualify customers upfront through their characteristics, and matching them with product characteristics.

Most processing structures in Telcos today, from commercial offerings to infrastructure configurations, are dominantly structured around repeatability, where standardized specifications are used to serve the needs of the many. Common denominators are obtained from market research to design products that will appeal a broad number of people, usually grouped together in Customer Segments. All customers in that segment are usually treated the same way, and all instances of customers with the same instances product are classified and processed with the same repeatable logic. For example, a customer's eligibility for a product that requires the Telco to make up-front investments like providing subsidized devices is usually accessed using a decision tree that use imperative logic and forward-chaining. The customer's credit rating, history, and other characteristics are processed to judge whether they are eligible to obtain a product. Ineligible customers for a product either find themselves at the mercy of repeating the process until they find a fit, or if they have the good fortunate of dealing with a knowledgeable agent, being pointed towards a product where they can surmount the eligibility checks. Similarly, when many customers are provisioned with the same product, the same specifications are used to instantiate customer profiles, billing records, service configurations, and resource configurations. New specifications are required when the specific situation of a customer makes the standard specification unprovisionable, such as whether they live in a remote mountain top or crowded building with several lines or whether the Telco's product is operable with the customer's existing devices. As the number of specifications grow, so do the number of rules and conditions that need to be checked. Most Telcos solve this situational variety by selecting the set of situations they can service. Either by making upfront checks to decide the feasibility of providing a product or by offering simplified products that do not cater for any variety. By rejecting customers who don't fulfil a product's criteria, Telcos miss out on acquiring customers and revenue opportunities.

Therefore equate a customer's demand with products that can be supplied by matching the characteristics of the customer, the customer's installed base, and the customer's preferences with the characteristics of products, the ability of the products to complement the customer's existing installed base, and the ability to meet the customer's preferences. Give customers and products to exist in their own unique combinations and situations, and possess the ability to interpret unique customer and product situations.

Use a Language for Instances to describe the unique situation and context for customers and products, and use this Language for Instances to match the characteristics of customers with the available products. Make it possible for Aware Instances to be in control of their own Product Markers.
