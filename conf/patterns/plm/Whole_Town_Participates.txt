Whole Town Participates

Create common targets for the whole company where all individual can participate in product community. The first customers of a product are internal staff. Whole town tests together.

Large organizations are divided into departments, which is necessary because... A common instrument of managing goals for individuals is targets, the fulfillment of which reaps financial rewards for individuals. Top down, strategy broken down, little goals. Departments get their own goals, but Individuals only fulfill things within their targets When Targets for an individual are set by historic precedents, and rely on repeating the past effectively. Targets are translated in terms of a department. Technology department focused on transformation while Marketing department focused on maximizing on variations of existing products, while Sales department focused on continuous innovations on existing products.

Therefore, create common targets for the whole company where all individual can participate in product community. The first customers of a product are internal staff.
