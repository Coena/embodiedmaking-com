                    <p>Embodied making is an action research approach that requires participation, engagement and
                        reflection. In action research, the designer works with rather than for people, is engaged as an
                        equal in terms of understanding the design environment, and takes a reflective stance with
                        regard to the work being done.
                    </p>
                    } {
                    <p>Embodied making requires that all participants within the design process have a strong
                        understanding of actual situations that occur in the domain of the design. A strong
                        understanding of these situations, and why they occur, provide key inferences for design
                        decisions and architectural criteria.

                    @methodSlide("1-2") {
                    <p>Embodied making comes from two inter-related terms. Embodiment is a thought movement
                        that considers the mind to be realized by the entire body and effective thinking to be
                        inseparable from doing. Making emphasizes the active role in designers in engaged change.
                        Embodied making is an alternative to other design methods which separate the design process from
                        the realization process and the realization process from living with the designed results.
                    </p>
                    } {
                    <p>In contrast to embodied making, there are a number of other design methods and frameworks
                        that encourage the use of layers to separate concerns. The assumption in this case is that
                        some people do the thinking as that’s what they are good at, and others do the doing as
                        that’s what they are good at. Each layer is used to create specializations.
                    </p>

                    @methodSlide("1-3") {
                    <p>Embodied making de-mystifies the design process from belonging to an exclusive few and makes it
                        accessible to everyone engaged in an enterprise. It encourages both doing and thinking to be
                        enterprise-wide activities. It discourages practices where one set of people do the thinking and
                        another set of people do to the doing. It encourages the use of minimal structures and lays
                        emphasis on improvization. "I act, therefore I think".
                    </p>
                    } {
                    <p>This belief of separation of thinking and doing is reflective of the belief of separation of mind
                        and body, perhaps most well articulated by “I think therefore I am”, creating organizations
                        which believe that thinking should happen in one place, and the doing in another. Embodied
                        making is designed to treat both thinking and doing integrally.

                    <p>Embodied making is an inter-disciplinary approach to systems designs. It draws inspiration from
                        several disciplines such as philosophy, architecture, mathematics, science, sociology,
                        psychology, literature, and music. Each of these disciplines has logical and analogical lessons
                        that have been applied to develop embodied making. Embodied making has been applied to develop
                        software applications, human management systems, enterprise architecture, organizational
                        structures, interior designs, and community structures.

                    <p>In practice, it is not possible to separate thinking from doing. Performing the same task twice
                        is never exactly the same, and new circumstances, altered environments, changing roles, new
                        insights, unforeseen situations, and unintended applications make the process of doing an active
                        process of thinking.

                        technology, equipment, infrastructure, and organizations. It can be used to develop designs that
                        address human behavior, technological considerations, organizational structures, equipment
                        utilization, and infrastructure usage. It was originally developed to address the limitations of
                        methods and frameworks that encourage a separation of thinking and doing, or provided design
                        methods that have a narrow focus on a single discipline or aspect of design.

                        Sociologists, Artists, Engineers, Enterprise Architects, Interior Architects, and Programmers.
                        This strong inter- disciplinary approach has contributed to a method that can be used to design
                        behavioral, sociological, and technological solutions.

                        to find several solutions for the same problem. It also provides the means to evaluate solution
                        effectiveness for a given environment.
