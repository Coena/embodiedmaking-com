        @methodSlide("1-1") {
        <p>Embodied making is an action research approach that requires participation, engagement and
            reflection. In action research, the designer works with rather than for people, is engaged as an
            equal in terms of understanding the design environment, and takes a reflective stance with
            regard to the work being done.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>Embodied making requires that all participants within the design process have a strong
            understanding of actual situations that occur in the domain of the design. A strong
            understanding of these situations, and why they occur, provide key inferences for design
            decisions and architectural criteria.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("1-2") {
        <p>Embodied making comes from two inter-related terms. Embodiment is a thought movement
            that considers the mind to be realized by the entire body and effective thinking to be
            inseparable from doing. Making emphasizes the active role in designers in engaged change.
            Embodied making is an alternative to other design methods which separate the design process from
            the realization process and the realization process from living with the designed results.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>In contrast to embodied making, there are a number of other design methods and frameworks
            that encourage the use of layers to separate concerns. The assumption in this case is that
            some people do the thinking as that’s what they are good at, and others do the doing as
            that’s what they are good at. Each layer is used to create specializations.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("1-3") {
        <p>Embodied making de-mystifies the design process from belonging to an exclusive few and makes it
            accessible to everyone engaged in an enterprise. It encourages both doing and thinking to be
            enterprise-wide activities. It discourages practices where one set of people do the thinking and
            another set of people do to the doing. It encourages the use of minimal structures and lays
            emphasis on improvization. "I act, therefore I think".
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>This belief of separation of thinking and doing is reflective of the belief of separation of mind
            and body, perhaps most well articulated by “I think therefore I am”, creating organizations
            which believe that thinking should happen in one place, and the doing in another. Embodied
            making is designed to treat both thinking and doing integrally.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("1-4") {
        <p>Embodied making is an inter-disciplinary approach to systems designs. It draws inspiration from
            several disciplines such as philosophy, architecture, mathematics, science, sociology,
            psychology, literature, and music. Each of these disciplines has logical and analogical lessons
            that have been applied to develop embodied making. Embodied making has been applied to develop
            software applications, human management systems, enterprise architecture, organizational
            structures, interior designs, and community structures.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>In practice, it is not possible to separate thinking from doing. Performing the same task twice
            is never exactly the same, and new circumstances, altered environments, changing roles, new
            insights, unforeseen situations, and unintended applications make the process of doing an active
            process of thinking.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("1-5") {
        <p>Embodied making is especially suitable for designing complex systems that involve people,
            technology, equipment, infrastructure, and organizations. It can be used to develop designs that
            address human behavior, technological considerations, organizational structures, equipment
            utilization, and infrastructure usage. It was originally developed to address the limitations of
            methods and frameworks that encourage a separation of thinking and doing, or provided design
            methods that have a narrow focus on a single discipline or aspect of design.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>The team developing embodied making is an inter-disciplinary one, consisting of Philosophers,
            Sociologists, Artists, Engineers, Enterprise Architects, Interior Architects, and Programmers.
            This strong inter- disciplinary approach has contributed to a method that can be used to design
            behavioral, sociological, and technological solutions.

        <p>This document provides a combination of examples and theory. It is layered in terms of primary
            concepts, support text, and an exhaustive bibliography for further reading. The best way to

            on each sheet as they read the document.

        <p>Embodied making is particularly useful in finding effective solutions for complex problems. It
            provides the means to understand complex problems for what they are, and then provides a means
            to find several solutions for the same problem. It also provides the means to evaluate solution
            effectiveness for a given environment.

        <p>
            The process of design with embodied making starts with listening to people in the space where we
            want our designs to live and rest. Stories are anecdotes as people relate them to us, and these
            are faithfully recorded as they are told to us.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>"We share 10 meeting rooms, usually named after people to identify them, between 300 people,
                and the meeting rooms need to be kept locked."
            </li>
            <li>"The receptionist helps book the room, and room users pick up the key, and usually drop it
                back."
            </li>
            <li>"Although people are supposed to pick up and drop off the key with me, they rarely do. I
                have to run around and try and trace where the keys are."
            </li>
            <li>"I often have back-to-back meetings, and I don’t always have time to return the key."
            </li>
            <li>"We lose keys to meeting rooms all the time and have to replace all the locks 3 or 4 times a
                year."
            </li>
            <li>"We need presentation equipment for meetings."
            </li>
        </ol>
        } { } {
        <p>
            Stories should be gathered from several perspectives. In the example of the meeting room,
            stories from the users of meeting rooms, building security, receptionists, moderators of
            meetings, visitors to the building to who come for a meeting, maintenance staff, or cleaning
            staff will help create a rich tapestry as the basis of designs.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("") {
        <p>What induces people to behave in the way they do in their environments? Or motivates them to
            decide on a particular course of action? These factors are called forces in embodied making.
            We can identify some of these forces from the stories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>F01. Meeting rooms are shared by a lot of people.</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>F02. Meeting rooms contain expensive equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>F03. Desire to protect equipment in meeting rooms.</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>F04. Limited number of meeting rooms.</li>
            <li><strong>2 </strong>F05. Meeting rooms are booked with a single point.</li>
            <li><strong>2 </strong>F06. Desire to pick up meeting room keys in 1 place.</li>
            <li><strong>2 </strong>F07. Desire to return keys in 1 place.</li>
            <li><strong>3 </strong>F08. Tendency for people to not return keys.</li>
            <li><strong>3 </strong>F09. Difficulty in tracking down unreturned keys.</li>
            <li><strong>4 </strong>F10. Individuals have several meetings without gaps.</li>
            <li><strong>4 </strong>F11. Returning keys is often inconvenient</li>
            <li><strong>5 </strong>F12. Frequent loss of meeting room keys.</li>
            <li><strong>5 </strong>F13. Inability to distinguish keys of meeting rooms.</li>
            <li><strong>6 </strong>F14. Use of high-quality equipment in meetings.</li>
        </ul>
        } { } {
        <p>As we catalog more and more stories from different perspectives, more and more forces
            will emerge. The objective of enumerating forces isn’t to try and find as many forces as
            possible. In order to give designers a feeling of the space where their designs will
            live and rest, the objective is to capture an adequate number of forces for reflection.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("2-3") {
        <p>
            If we are able to find an elegant solution that is both stable and reliable, and this solution would
            be able
            to balance all of these forces (let’s assume for now that these stories and forces are complete), we
            would
            have created a system that would fulfill the requirements of sharing meeting rooms effectively. We
            can gain
            insight into how these forces exist in their environments by exploring how they interact with each
            other, by
            placing a (+) sign for a pleasant experience, a (-) sign for an unpleasant experience, and (~) for a
            neutral
            experience.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>
            Understanding the interactions between forces helps designers live and experience them. For each
            interaction, try and imagine situations where those interactions between forces would occur. By
            thinking about each interaction, you will increasingly understand how all of these forces co-exist
            in the same space. Understanding the complex interactions has a meditative quality, and after while, a
            feeling of “living” the forces occurs for the designer.</p>
        }

        @methodSlide("") {
        <p>
            As designers, we must also be conscious of our own will, and that our involvement in the design process, and
            the systems we realize from those designs, actively transform the environment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>W01. Desire for low cost solutions</li>
            <li>W02. Desire not to inconvenience meeting room users.</li>
            <li>W03. Desire to keep organizational culture intact.</li>
            <li>W04. Desire to make meeting room usage fun.</li>
            <li>W05. Desire to use of common locks and keys.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There is no clear or sharp distinction between wills and forces. They come from two directions. Wills comes
            from self awareness of the designer or requirements of the patron, and forces come from observation of
            patterns of behavior, culture, or nature in the design environment. By integrating the perspectives of wills
            and forces, designers can propose solutions that 'work'. </p>
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>Throughout this process, the personal goals and objectives of the designer or designers should be explicitly
            stated as wills. Interactions between wills and forces reveal their conduciveness to exist in the same
            space.</p>
        }

        @methodSlide("2-5") {
        <p>
            An understanding of the forces and wills gives insight into the solutions that would be most likely to
            resolve them.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>
            As we think about the forces, and the interactions between forces, ideas will flow on how to resolve them.
            Each idea should be written down as a solution component, examining how it helps resolves the immediate
            forces we have considered, and all the forces that emerge afterwards. There is no fixed sequence on writing
            any of them down.</p>
        }

        @methodSlide("2-6") {
        <p>
            And finally, we can realize and unify the solution using a combination of analogies and metaphors. For
            example, using the metaphor of a petting zoo...
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>
            In this example, we want to create compassion and empathy, and we can achieve this by finding analogies or
            metaphors that inspire those emotions. There is a natural tendency for human beings to care for their pets.
            Animals should be selected for the vulnerability, and a connection to the planet can be found through
            featuring endangered animals.</p>

        @methodSlide("3-1") {
        <p>
            Formal and informal systems within large organizations are built with the perspectives of several individuals. There is a tendency for influential individuals to create a bias within systems in favor. To avoid this, it is important to engage at every level of an organization (if formal levels exist), and assembling an accurate picture of what is required from effective systems. Insights gained through this process of inquiry are key in making organizations efficient and effective.
        </p>
        } { } {
        <p>
            For instance, consider the features necessary for a new company-wide computer system where your primary stakeholders are from departments representing internal financial administration. It is probable that most functions in this new system would help create stability and efficiency for internal administration but not other tasks.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide2("3-2") {
        <p>
            When applying embodied making, it important the voices of individuals to find their way into the system design. The best person to teach you about production processes is someone working on the floor every day. This has to be balanced with stakeholders such as organizational leaders, who may have a different perspective the characteristics of an effective system. Cataloging perspectives openly will help create balanced systems that meet the needs of people across the organization.
        </p>
        } {
            Many systems have a tendency to be designed based on simplistic “sunny day scenarios”. Organization-wide participation ensures that the essential complexity that exists in everyday tasks finds its way into the formal system.
        } {
        <p>
            Examples of some individuals bending the system to create stability for themselves range from system maintainers choosing to make upgrades at times most convenient for themselves but not for the system’s users, or ERP systems that design all work tasks based solely on financial rules, or production systems structured to help management reporting.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide2("3-3") {
        <p>
            When a formal mandate exists to design a new system, system designers tend to find themselves overwhelmed with participants who want to influence the system’s design. On the contrary, when no formal charter exists, it becomes quite hard to find individuals willing to engage and provide their insights. In either case, it is best to engage with individuals in small circles, exceeding no more than 2 or 3 individuals for each session (including the designer), and widening circles progressively.
        </p>
        } {
            Individuals are more likely to voice their experiences and ideas in smaller circles in an informal context. The bigger the circle, the more the combination of interactions possible, which after 5 people, becomes very difficult to coordinate and manage.
        } {
        <p>
            If the system has to facilitate tasks performed by a specific group of individuals, involve these individuals in the design process as early as possible. For instance, in order to design an effective point-of-sale system, involve store sales staff who work with the system everyday as they are the most likely group with ideas on how to improve their work.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide2("3-4") {
        <p>
            Sharing experiences and ideas with broader circles is most effectively done through records of these interactions, either in the form of written text, recorded audio, or recorded video. Records of these experiences and ideas should be easy to find and share, and others that are unfamiliar with the context of the records should be able to understand them easily.
        </p>
        } {
            It is often awkward to record a conversation as it is taking place. Participants may not be as open to sharing experiences as they would be without recording media or knowing that they will be quoted. Nevertheless, persisting in recording conversations makes it possible to share them, and apply them in system design.
        } {
        <p>
            Reluctance in recording experiences stems from either the experience being of a sensitive nature that may have negative implications of the narrator or characters in the narrative, or the experience being partially or complete untrue, or from a hidden agenda of the narrator. If an experience cannot be shared, its value in system design is limited.        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide2("3-5") {
        <p>
            Constant reflection on decision-making is required through the entire lifecycle of a system, ranging from inception, design, implementation, operation, alteration, deprecation, and retirement. Whenever there seems to be a definite course of action for a system, reflection on why this is so is valuable step to consider balanced approaches. Past practices provide experience, but they also deceptively lull us into trying to repeat the past. As fundamental and obvious as the need for reflection may be, it tends to occur a lot less than it should in daily practice.
        </p>
        } {
            Be wary of an obvious course of action. Why is it obvious? Is it because everyone else does it? Or because it is an existing habit? Be wary of thoughtless mimicry on emergent forms. Respect stable forms by understanding the forces that have shaped them.
        } {
        <p>
            It may seem that a specific set of functionality is absolutely required, but functionality that has been essential in the past may not be essential anymore. It may seem that a particular technology stack is optimal for all problems given that it is a standard of sorts, but the technology stack may have been built for another purpose.
        </p>
        }

        @methodSlide("3-6") {
        <p>
            The process of reflection must extend to the methods we employ to solve our problems. All methods, including embodied making, have their limitations. Possessing knowledge of handful of methods that are useful in different situations The process of reflection should include determining the optimal methods and the necessary frame-of-mind required to solve complex problems. No single method can predict the rich variety of situations you will face, and single-mindedly applying a method is dangerous.
        </p>
        } {
            When all you’ve got is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Don’t bring a jackhammer when a hammer will do. A fool with a tool is still a fool. A toolbox with a variety of basic tools is often adequate for most designers.
        } {
        <p>
            Embodied making is especially powerful at capturing human experience, and it complements other knowledge management techniques that are ontological, which are powerful at creating logical methods or intentional, which are powerful at reflecting processes. We strongly encourage the use of other methods alongside embodied making.        </p>
